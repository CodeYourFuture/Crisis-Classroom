He have been asked to create a digital lesson plan template.For now teachers are using powerpoint that takes them one hour to make the lesson plan.


We are going to reduce this time by asking them to fill a form ,then template will be ready to show, save,print and also edit as well.

Form will be filled by some images and texts.
lesson plan is turned into a downloadable image.

We also need to implement an authentication for users to sign in and log in.
