      <p>
        Crisis Classroom is a CIC that offers training to volunteers on a
        not-for profit basis. All profits go into providing funded training
        opportunities for refugee educators, seed-funding for long-term projects
        (6months+) and supporting volunteer-led educational classes, courses and
        projects in the field. We are also a restricted fund under the auspices
        of Prism the Gift Fund 1099682 which means that all donations receive
        Gift Aid.
