        <p>
          No matter who you are, how old you are or where in the world you are,
          we believe with all our hearts that education isnâ€™t a privilege but a
          fundamental human right. We uphold this right, we fight for it and we
          enable it. Unconstrained by bricks and mortar, unconcerned by age
          limits our classrooms are open to everyone. More than just algebra and
          verbs, this is relearning life in another language. To ask for a loaf
          of bread, to make new friends, to talk to a doctor about your child.
          This is education that helps you take back control and regain a sense
          of self so that life can begin.
        </p>
        <h1>PROJECTS IN PROGRESS</h1>
      </div>
